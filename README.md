# COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker
The COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker project aims to analyze and visualize the global progress of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Tracking vaccination efforts is crucial for understanding the distribution and efficacy of immunization programs worldwide. The project will utilize real-time data sourced from reputable sources such as WHO, CDC, and national health agencies.

Key objectives of the project include:

    demographics, and geographic distribution.
  	
2.  Visualization: Developing interactive visualizations and dashboards to present the findings in a user-friendly format. Visual representations will include maps, and graphs to convey
   insights on vaccination progress at global, national, and local levels.
   
3.  Impact Assessment: Evaluating the impact of vaccination campaigns on controlling the spread of COVID-19, reducing hospitalizations and fatalities, and mitigating the socioeconomic
    effects of the pandemic.
